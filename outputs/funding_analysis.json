Investment Attractiveness Score (Tentative based on Co-investor Presence):
- The presence of significant co-investors such as Reach Capital and Monashees indicates high interest in these startups. Investment attractiveness, assessed on co-investor reputation alone, could be a provisional 7 or 8 out of 10. However, a lack of further financial detail makes any deeper assessment speculative.

Unfortunately, precise funding history, valuation trends, and direct insights into investor quality, as would be predicated on tangible funding round data, were unavailable. For a detailed understanding of their financial health and attractiveness beyond merely co-investor names, direct company disclosures or more specialized investment databases might be required.
